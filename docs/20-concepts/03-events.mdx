Events in KoliBri can be processed as DOM Events or as Callbacks.

### DOM Events

The component's events can be handled using event listeners, which may be called with a `details` parameter:

```js
kolibriElement.addEventListener('kolFocus', (event) => {
	/* Do something on focus */
});

kolibriElement.addEventListener('kolInput', (event, { detail: value }) => {
	/* Do something with value or event */
});
```


### Callbacks

The component's callbacks can be handled using an `_on` property, which consists of an object with various callback functions:

```js
kolibriElement._on = {
	onFocus: (event) => {
		/* Do something on focus */
	},
	onInput: (event, value) => {
		/* Do something with value or event */
	}
};
```
