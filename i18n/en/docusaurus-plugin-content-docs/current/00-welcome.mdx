## Vision

Together, we make <strong>HTML semantically accessible using reusable Web Components</strong> to ensure{' '}
<strong>usability</strong> and <strong>accessibility</strong>.

## Mission

The <KolLink _label="HTML web standard" _href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org" _target="_blank" /> is specified to be very "open" in order to be as durable and robust as possible. It therefore often happens that HTML compositions are not readily accessible, semantic and valid.
<KoliBri /> builds directly on the <KolLink _label="W3C" _href="https://www.w3.org" _target="_blank"/>
<KolLink _label="web standards" _href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/" _target="_blank" /> (framework-agnostic), is thereby a generic reference implementation of the
<KolLink _label="WCAG standard" _href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" _target="_blank" /> and
<KolLink _label="BITV" _href="https://www.bitvtest.de/bitv_test.html" _target="_blank" /> for accessibility, and is implemented as a multi-theme-enabled presentation layer. There is no technical reference and
no data transfer functionalities. This makes <KoliBri /> equally reusable for the realization of static websites as
well as dynamic web applications of different corporate designs and style guides and thus very interesting for open
source.

## Collaboration and cooperation

The <strong>focus</strong> of <KoliBri /> is on <strong>small</strong> (atomic), very <strong>flexible</strong> and
well <strong>reusable</strong> HTML compositions (e.g. button). We provide an accessible, semantic and valid standard
implementation of such components that can be reused for any higher-level HTML structure or component (molecule,
organism or template).

We should <strong>collaborate</strong> and <strong>cooperate</strong> on these atomic components in order to bundle
our skills and knowledge. Through the synergy effects at the basic components, our own focus can be placed more on
subject-specific content.

Let <strong>us</strong> make <KoliBri /> <strong>better</strong> and more <strong>colorful</strong>{' '}
<strong>together</strong>!

## License

<KoliBri /> is released under the <strong>EUROPEAN UNION PUBLIC LICENCE v1.2</strong> open source. The following
aspects are in particular thereby considered:

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Making accessible</strong>: The artifacts and source code can be reused freely and without charge by
		anyone. In this way, the ITZBund makes a contribution in the sense of <KolLink _label="‚ÄúPublic Money ‚Äì Public Code‚Äù" _href="https://publiccode.eu/" _target="_blank" />.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Warranty and liability disclaimer</strong>: No warranty or liability claims are associated with the reuse.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>‚ÄúCopyleft‚Äù clause</strong>: Copyleft states that any copy of <KoliBri /> (fork) must be re-released under
		the same or a compatible open-source license.
	</li>
</ul>

## Delimitation

To use <KoliBri /> correctly, it is important to know where it unleashes its potential. <KoliBri /> is reusable in
many ways because the styling has been completely decoupled and rendering is possible client-side but also
server-side.

### Styling

<KoliBri /> is neither a CSS framework nor a design system, but a library of frequently used components that have
accessibility and usability requirements. To avoid having to look at these requirements over and over again,{' '}
<KoliBri /> uses Web Components to create an overarching uniform standard for all style guides here.

The more relevant components are found and implemented, the more value is added to all web-based projects. However,{' '}
<KoliBri /> does not aim to implement components without accessibility and usability requirements. Standard HTML and
CSS or alternative CSS frameworks can be used for this purpose.

<KolAlert _type="success" _variant="card">
	<KoliBri /> components can be seamlessly integrated into existing websites or web applications and provide their
	style (guide) themselves, encapsulating it almost completely from the outside.
</KolAlert>

### Rendering

Web components can be rendered on the client side (CSR), prerendered (SSG), or on the server side (SSR). The rendering
depends on the respective technical framework conditions (<KolLink _label="https://web.dev" _href="https://web.dev/rendering-on-the-web/" _target="_blank" />, <KolLink _label="https://medium.com" _href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/compare-and-contrast-csr-ssr-and-ssg-in-nextjs-58e3caf2e15e" _target="_blank" />).

<KolAlert _type="info" _variant="card">
	<small>
		üí° It should be noted that Web Components is a JavaScript-based web standard. Server-side rendering allows the Web
		Component to be rendered for optimal display speed on the client. If client-side JavaScript is allowed, the full
		dynamics of the Web Component are also available client-side. However, if you want to avoid using JavaScript on
		the client side, the Web Component is rendered, but the dynamics are lost.

<KolAlert _type="info" _variant="card">
	<small>
		üß™ Server-side rendering of Web Components is an exciting new functionality where adjustments to the prerenderer
		will still be necessary and is therefore classified as experimental on our part (<KolLink _label="https://web.dev" _href="https://web.dev/declarative-shadow-dom/" _target="_blank" />).
	</small>
</KolAlert>

## Versioning

<KoliBri /> follows the principles of semantic versioning.

<strong>Structure</strong> of a version:
<ul>
	<li>
		It usually consists of 3 parts (e.g. 1.0.2)
		<ul>
			<li>
				Major, here the <i>1</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				Minor, here the <i>0</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				Patch, here the <i>2</i>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		For the release phase of a version, you can use additional labels (e.g. 1.0.3-rc.2)
		<ul>
			<li>
				Label, here the <i>rc.2</i>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

The following <strong>main principles</strong> are applied:
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Patch</b>: Includes changes that improve the current functionality and do not change its use.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Minor</b>: Includes changes that extend the functional scope and do not change the existing functional scope in
		its use.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Major</b>: Includes changes that enable architectural realignment and are allowed to change the use of the
		existing feature set.
	</li>
</ul>

## Quality objectives

The following table lists the prioritized qualities of <KoliBri />:

<WelcomeQualityTable lang="en" />

## Device, operating system, browser and screen reader requirements

<KoliBri /> is intended for the implementation of any web-based user interfaces and should be able to be used on all
modern devices (PC, tablet, mobile), operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS) and standards-compliant
browsers.
<br />
Microsoft Internet Explorer is explicitly not supported in order not to weaken the project and the development by
legacy. Instead, <KoliBri /> consistently invests in the future.
