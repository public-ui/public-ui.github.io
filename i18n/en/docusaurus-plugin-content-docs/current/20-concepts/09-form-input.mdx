import { KolLink } from '@public-ui/react';

As part of the refactoring to improve the developer experience, we have restructured the input components and converted them into separate components according to the <KolLink _label="W3C separation" _href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html" _target="_blank" />.
In this way, the respective components only provide the properties that also have a function for the respective type. Properties that were previously maintained but had no function were removed from the programming.

## Vergleich zum HTML-Tag &lt;input&gt;

<p>
	If you look at the <KolLink _label="" _href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input" _target="_blank">
		<span slot="expert"><code>&lt;input&gt;</code>-tag</span>
	</KolLink>, then all types of an input field are implemented with only one tag (component). This results in the fact that all properties (attributes/properties) are
	possible, but have no function depending on the type.
</p>

<p>
	This implementation of the standard <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag leads to the fact that usually more properties are offered than actually fit functionally
	to the type of the input field. This can lead to misunderstandings during development.
</p>

## Division

<p>
	The different types of input fields have been divided into the following <b>KoliBri</b> components:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>KolInputCheckbox</li>
	<li>KolInputColor</li>
	<li>KolInputDate (ab v1.1.10)</li>
	<li>KolInputEmail</li>
	<li>KolInputFile</li>
	<li>KolInputLocalDateTime (open, part of KolInputDate)</li>
	<li>KolInputNumber</li>
	<li>KolInputPassword</li>
	<li>KolInputRadio (KolInputRadioGroup is replaced)</li>
	<li>KolInputRange</li>
	<li>KolInputText</li>
	<li>KolSelect</li>
	<li>KolTextarea</li>
</ul>
