# Create a KoliBri theme

> Note: The former Designer is no longer available; themes are now maintained directly in code.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<KolCard _label="Theme guide" _level={2}>
<KolLink _label="Guide in the KERN Developer Kit" _href="https://gitlab.opencode.de/kern-ux/kern-developer-kit/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" _target="_blank" _icons={{ left: 'codicon codicon-repo-forked' }} />

Creating a custom theme now happens entirely in a Git repository. The approach follows the documentation in the [KERN Developer Kit](https://gitlab.opencode.de/kern-ux/kern-developer-kit/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Steps

1. **Fork an existing theme:** Use a current theme as a baseline and create your own repository from it (for example via a fork or `git clone`). This keeps the structure KoliBri expects for styling.
2. **Apply your style guide:** Adapt the existing styles, variables, and tokens to your style guide. Work directly in the code of the forked theme to derive colors, spacing, typography, and component variants consistently.
3. **Version the theme:** Commit your changes regularly and keep the theme repository well documented. This ensures the theme remains traceable and reusable over time.
4. **Use the theme:** Consume the finished theme from your repository in your projects so applications can use the customized styles without the Designer.

## Notes

- If you need global CSS rules (for example for zoom levels, hyphenation, or spacing), add them directly in your theme.
- For Sass workflows you can still use the [Scss approach](/en/docs/concepts/styling/scss) to organize your styles modularly.
