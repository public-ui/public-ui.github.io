# ButtonLink

The ButtonLink is semantically a button and has the design of a link. For this purpose, all relevant properties of the button component are adopted and expanded to include the design-determining properties of the link.

A button can be deactivated and therefore a ButtonLink has the property `_disabled`. The UX designer decides how this will be visually designed.

Instead of using `_href` like with a link, with a ButtonLink the property is controlled via the `click callback`. The `_on` property is used for this.

A link has the property `target`, which may open the link in a new window/tab. The behavior has not yet been implemented.

Since the link, unlike the button, is offered in several variants (primary or secondary, etc.), the properties `_customClass` and `_variant` are not available.

## Construction

<ButtonLinkPreview 
  initialProps={{ _label: 'Schalter sieht wie ein Link aus' }}
  visibleProperties={[
    '_label',
    '_disabled',
    '_hideLabel',
    '_icons'
  ]}
  codeCollapsable
  codeCollapsed
/>

### Events

For the handling of events or callbacks, see <kol-link _label="Events" _href="../concepts/events" />.

| Event | trigger | Value |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `click` | Element is clicked | `_value` property |
| `onMouseDown` | A pointing device key is pressed while the pointer is inside the element | - |
