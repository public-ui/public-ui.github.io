As an open source project, it is important for KoliBri to have a community around
to build up the topic of accessible basic components. So for this too
optimal accessibility is given, all technical
Specifications must be available in at least **English**. As in the
Science allows for feedback and participation from all potential
areas.

## Todo

### English specification

The technical specification is automatically generated from the source code
and synchronized. All the information we put from the source code into the
Transfer specification, will in future only be in **English**
provided.

This concerns, for example:

- API specification on the website
- Details in IDE autocompletion
- Representations generated from the meta data of the source code

### Multilinguale Dokumentation

In the future (in the medium term), the documentation will primarily include all content in
**German** and secondary in **English** provided.

This concerns, for example:

- Instructions, concepts, examples and much more.
- Blog posts
