	<blockquote>We make the HTML accessible and themable for reuse.</blockquote>
	<h2>§ 1 Useability</h2>
	<p>
		The ultimate goal is to provide standardized, semantically accessible components for the web. We ensure this by means of clearly defined component APIs and
		restrictive access to the interior of the components. The usability of the components is largely driven by the test steps of the WCAG and BITV, which
		standardizes the behavior of the individual interactive elements. Building on this basis, the aesthetics of the components can be freely designed by means
		of the decoupled KoliBri Designer.
	</p>
	<h2>§ 2 Compatibility</h2>
	<p>
		All components are implemented framework-agnostically as Web Components and can thus be easily reused universally in all web-based projects. Additionally,
		we offer numerous adapters for the most popular frameworks to provide an even better Developer Experience (DX).
	</p>
	<h2>§ 3 Portability</h2>
	<p>
		The focus is on small components (e.g. buttons) that can be easily reused. The special thing about this is that an HTML button or input is not accessible
		without further ado. However, a KoliBri button or input takes into account the numerous use cases and the semantic construction of the components that must
		be considered.
	</p>
	<h2>§ 4 Maintainability</h2>
	<p>
		The most modern and popular tools from web development are used for the realization. In addition to the TypeScript programming language, aspects of
		reusability for other design systems and component libraries have also been incorporated. The architecture is subject to a decoupled modularity and high
		degree of automation (DevOps).
	</p>
	<h2>§ 5 Functional Suitability</h2>
	<p>
		There is no perfect solution. However, the claim is to functionally enable everything that is overarching and compatible with the strict view of the W3C web
		standards. Functionalities can thus either flow into the components of KoliBri itself or be added by means of the swizzling concept.
	</p>
	<h2>§ 6 Security</h2>
	<p>
		All components serve solely to achieve a consistent and accessible representation of web-based user interfaces in the sense of a corporate design or design
		system. We provide a universally applicable and subject-neutral library without any data transfer functionalities and storage.
	</p>
