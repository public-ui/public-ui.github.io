	The unique feature of <KoliBri /> is the <strong>reference implementation</strong> of components that are{' '}
	<strong>semantically W3C- and WCAG-compliant</strong> from the ground up and thus <strong>completely accessible</strong> regarding assistive support. All
	components are implemented as{' '}
	<KolLink _href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components?retiredLocale=de" _target="mozilla">
		Web Components
	</KolLink>{' '}
	and are therefore reusable in all web-based projects. In the following figure, these components are represented by the gray-dashed shapes in the center.
</p>
<p>
	<KolIndentedText>
		<strong>1. KoliBri components could be reused as a basis for all design systems or component libraries.</strong>
	</KolIndentedText>
</p>

<p>
	In the first release (v1.0) <KoliBri /> had directly implemented the individualization of the standard design using so-called{' '}
	<strong>
		<KolLink _href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties" _target="mozilla">
			CSS-Properties
		</KolLink>
	</strong>{' '}
	(
	<KolLink _href="https://uxdesign.cc/design-tokens-for-dummies-8acebf010d71" _target="uxdesign">
		Design-Tokens
	</KolLink>
	, <KolLink _href="https://tailwindcss.com" _target="tailwindcss">
		Tailwind CSS
	</KolLink>). With the implementation of further themes, however, we have found that we would have to introduce more and more CSS-Properties to be able to implement
	the flexibility for the desired design/UX (Corporate Design/Style guide). In case of doubt, a separate property would have to be provided for each customizability.
	The example of the <KolLink _href="https://mui.com/material-ui/api/button/#css" _target="mui">
		MUI-Button CSS
	</KolLink> shows well how the CSS properties (design tokens) become more and more.
</p>
<p>
	<KolIndentedText>
		<strong>
			2. We have completely decoupled the whole CSS from the components (like{' '}
			<KolLink _href="https://styled-components.com" _target="styled-components">
				Styled-Components
			</KolLink>
			).
		</strong>
	</KolIndentedText>
</p>
<p>
	Using the designer, a “client” can design the components individually and completely independently with all the CSS freedom. Within a “client” theme, custom
	CSS properties can be introduced. The use of CSS properties (design tokens) is thus preserved at the theme level, but with a much smaller and maintainable
	scope.
</p>
<p>
	<KolIndentedText>
		<strong>
			3. KoliBri allows the reuse of tested, accessible and robust components (constructions) with almost individual design and thus represents a freely
			customizable HTML standard in the context of accessibility.
		</strong>

	For example, the UI/UX team specifies the components of their design system with Figma. When the specification is transferred to implementation, the design is
	“transferred” to the basic components in the form of pure CSS using <KolLink _href="/docs/concepts/styling/designer">KoliBri-Designers</KolLink>. If
	customizability is desired in your design system, CSS properties or design tokens can be defined in the Designer for this purpose. So that the own theme can
	be shared across projects, the theme is packaged in an NPM package and can be made available via any registry.
</p>
<p>
	<KolDetails _summary="Design-Tokens">
		Optionally, design schemes can be exported from Figma, for example, using design tokens. These can then be transferred into separate CSS files that contain
		the respective values for the CSS properties. Later, one of these CSS files is used to apply the concrete design in combination with the Web Components and
		the theme on the website.
	</KolDetails>
</p>
<p>
	<KolDetails _summary="Dark-Mode">
		Optionally, a “dark mode” theme can also be implemented. For this, the required CSS can be stored in the globals of the KoliBri theme.

		Own specific components, which are not provided by KoliBri and unfortunately do not fit to the KoliBri component variety, can be built in own component
		libraries and maintained independently. For this purpose, we offer the so-called <strong>KoliBri-Factory</strong> (Stack) (see{' '}
