The assets folder typically contains all the static files that your project needs to function, that are not directly related to the codebase. These can include images, stylesheets (CSS files), scripts (JavaScript files), fonts, and other multimedia content. These files are often served directly to the user by the server, and are essential for the correct visual presentation and functionality of your application.
